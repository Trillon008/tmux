# Tmux 

This is my tmux configuration, which I use everyday    
It is meant to be simple, clean  but provides efficient key mapping   
It's greatly inspired from the work of Dustin Kirkland with byobu          
Use help menu: Shift+F1


## Install 
git clone    
cp tmux.conf ${HOME}/.tmux.conf       
cp -r tmux/ ${HOME}/.tmux
